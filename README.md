Logs on resovling various issues when installing LFS

LFS https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/

Actually setting up a system from scratch is really time-consuming

There are tons of issues to be fixed

It took me weeks to finished the building

And as the base system was brought up, still there are software installations issues to be fixed

It really made me appreciate the work done by various distribution vendors
